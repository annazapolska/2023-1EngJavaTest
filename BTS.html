    <P>     BTS, in full <b>Bangtan Sonyeondan</b> (from Korean “Bulletproof Boy Scouts” or “Bangtan Boys”), is </br>
        a South Koream k-pop group. They debuted in June 13th, 2013 and gained the world popularity. </P>
    <p>     BTS was formed by Bang Si-Hyuk, a successful songwriter and music producer who established his  </br>
        own studio, Big Hit Entertainment, in 2005. The band’s first releases were three EP (extended  play)</br>
        records in the School series, including <i>2 Cool 4 Skool </i> (2013), <i>O!RUL8,2?</i> (2013), and </br>
        <i>Skool Luv Affair</i> (2014). BTS’s first full-length album, <u>Dark & Wild</u>, appeared in 2014. The </br>
        group wrote its own lyrics, commenting on social issues and concentrating on such themes as self-love,  </br>
        individuality, and empowerment. </p>
